	  <h3>Tutorial: Stream Reasoning: Managing Velocity and Variety in Big Data </h3>
	  <b>Abstract:</b>
	  <p>
Many “big data” applications must process large volumes of heterogeneous data in real-time or near real-time to create new knowledge.
The research on Semantic Web has focused on the variety of data, devising data representation and processing techniques that promote the integration and reasoning on available data to produce new knowledge.
On the other hand, the community working on event and stream processing has focused on the velocity of data, producing systems that efficiently operate on streams of data on-the-fly according to pre-deployed processing rules or queries.
Several recent works explore the synergy between stream processing and reasoning to fully capture the requirements of modern data intensive applications. This gave birth to the research domain of stream reasoning.
This tutorial offers a detailed presentation of the theoretical and technological achievements in stream reasoning, highlighting the key benefits and limitations of existing approaches, and discussing the open issues and opportunities for future research.
The tutorial is conceived for an audience that is familiar with the models and systems for event and stream processing. It aims to further promote the integration of reasoning and event and stream processing in two ways: (i) it presents an active research domain, where researchers on event and stream processing can apply their expertise; (ii) it overviews reasoning techniques and technologies that can help advancing the state of the art in event and stream processing.   <br/><br/>Further details are available from the workshop website at: <a href="http://streamreasoning.org/events/srdebs2016">http://streamreasoning.org/events/srdebs2016</a>.</a>

	<b>Presenters:</b> 

	<p>
<b>Emanuele Della Valle</b> is an Assistant Professor of Software
Project Management at the Department of Electronics and
Information at Politecnico di Milano. He tries to perform
research that is justified and guided by business needs. His
major interest is in translating research results into business opportunities. In more than a decade of research,
his research interests covered Semantic Web, Web Services,
Service Oriented Architectures, Search Engines and, more
recently on Stream Management Systems and Rank-aware
Databases. His major research contributions are the stream
reasoning concept –an approach to master the velocity and
variety dimensions of Big Data–, and its embodiment in the
Continuous SPARQL query language and execution environment.
His education activities include lecturing on Software
Project Management, Semantic Technologies, Stream Processing and Big Data technologies. He offered Stream Reasoning tutorials at SemTech 2011, ESWC 2011, ISWC 2013,
ESWC 2014, ISWC 2014, and ISWC 2015. He offered a
tutorial about Realizing Semantic Web Applications at BIS
2008, ISWC 2008, and ICWE 2010.<br /><br />
<b>Daniele Dell'Aglio</b> is a PhD student at the Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria (DEIB) of the Politecnico di Milano since November 2012. His research activities focus on Stream Reasoning, i.e. the application of inference techniques to data streams. In his major research topic, he is studying the problem of evaluating continuous queries in presence of highly-dynamic and heterogeneous data. Daniele won an IBM PhD Fellowship award 2014, and he is currently involved in the activities of the W3C Community Group on RDF Stream Processing. From 2008 to 2012, Daniele worked as junior researcher and consultant at CEFRIEL. He participated in the Smart City research activities of the LarKC FP7 project and in research activities related to Web services and recommender systems in the SOA4All and the Service Finder FP7 projects. He holds a MSc and a BSc in computing system engineering (Politecnico di Milano). Daniele contributed in the realization of several prototypes of services in the urban context, such as BOTTARI (1st prize at the Semantic Web challenge 2011), Traffic LarKC (1st prize at the AI Mashup challenge 2011), Twindex and ECSTASYS (respectively 3rd prize at the AI Mashup challenge 2013 and 2014). 
<br /><br />
<b>Alessandro Margara</b> is an Assistant Professor at the Department of Electronics and Information at Politecnico di
Milano. Alessandro received his PhD from Politecnico di
Milano in 2012. He has been visiting research scholar at the
Purdue University and post-doctoral researcher at the Vrije
Universiteit Amsterdam (2012–2014) and at the Universit`
a
della Svizzera Italiana, Lugano (2014–2016).
Alessandro’s research interests focus on middleware solutions to ease the design and development of complex distributed systems, with a special emphasis on event stream
processing and reactive systems. The results of his research
have been published in international conferences and journals, including ACM Computing Surveys, IEEE Transactions of Parallel and Distributed Systems, ICSE, ICDCS,
Middleware, DEBS.
Related to the topic of the tutorial, Alessandro co-authored a survey on events and stream processing and
a paper on the analysis of the stream reasoning research
field. He co-authored a tutorial on event and stream
processing in DEBS 2011. He is a proposer and lecturer of
a course on Stream and Complex Event Processing for PhD
students at Politecnico di Milano and he is a guest lecturer
for a course on Concepts and Technologies for Distributed
Systems and Big Data Processing at TU Darmstadt.
