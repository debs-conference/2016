<h3 id="latex-instructions">LaTeX instructions</h3>
<p>Note: the main problem that occurs with submissions generated with <code>pdflatex</code>
 is that the fonts are not embedded properly. This most often occurs 
because vector images included from your LaTeX do not themselves embed 
their fonts. If we find problems with your PDF, and you are unable to 
submit a revised version with correctly embedded fonts, we may have to 
take a less desirable and less safe route: that you submit a PostScript 
(PS) version, from which we produce PDF.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Please use the sig-alternate class file you find under <a href="http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates">ACM Proceedings Template</a> for your submission</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When using this class file, you may want to fetch the additional sample files and instructions provided under<br><a href="http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates#aL2">Option 2: LaTeX2e</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The new ACM rights management options mean that the sig-alternate 
class does not automatically generate the correct copyright block,  but you can use some predefined templates.
Therefore, please download the acmcopyright.sty from the ACM template page as well.
 The email received from the ACM rights management system will have informed 
you of your specific DOI. Unlike in the past, this now needs to be 
included in your copyright block. There are three different forms of 
copyright block. You must use the one corresponding to what you selected
 during the rights management process.</p>
<p>Please double-check that your produced document matches the details 
in the email sent to you by the rights management system, and that you 
have included your full DOI URL.</p>

<h3 id="authors-complete-names-email-affiliation-and-affiliation-location">Authors’ complete names, email, affiliation and affiliation location</h3>
<p>Prior to submitting, be sure to update the final version of your PDF 
to include all authors full names, and correct affiliation names, 
location, and other information under the title of the paper. <a href="https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/article-templates/sig-alternate-sample.pdf">See page 1 of the ACM sample PDF</a>.</p>
<h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p>Authors must include a brief summary (abstract) of their work in the 
first section of their submission after the title, authors, and 
affiliation information on the first page. <a href="https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/article-templates/sig-alternate-sample.pdf">See page 1 of the ACM sample PDF</a>.</p>
<h3 id="references">References</h3>
<p>Authors must include all works cited in their submission in a <strong>References</strong> section at the end of the paper or extended abstract. <a href="https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/article-templates/sig-alternate-sample.pdf#page=4">See page 4 of the ACM sample PDF</a>.</p>
<h3 id="acm-classification-sections">ACM Classification Sections</h3>
<p>The <strong>“Categories and Subject Descriptors”</strong> and <strong>“Keywords”</strong> are mandatory by ACM on the first page of your submission after the Abstract. <a href="https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/article-templates/sig-alternate-sample.pdf">See page 1 of the ACM sample PDF</a> for information about how these two sections should appear in your submission.</p>
<p><strong>Read this section carefully</strong>. Your selections for the three sections are mandatory on the submission page when submitting your final version.</p>
<p><strong>Categories and Subject Descriptors (Mandatory for the first page of your paper)</strong>: Make sure that your selection included on the first page of your paper are also chosen accordingly on the submission page. <a href="http://www.acm.org/about/class/class/2012">Click here for information on the ACM Computing Classification Scheme</a>.</p>
<p><strong>General Terms (Mandatory in the submission system, but not mandatory on the first page of your paper)</strong>:
 The best way to understand the General Terms is that they are 
orthogonal to the subject categories, that is, they cut across all 
subjects. Please see also <a href="http://www.acm.org/about/class/class/2012">Click here for information on the ACM Computing Classification Scheme</a> </p>
<p><strong>Keywords:</strong><br>This section is your (author) choice of terms that you would like used to index your work.</p>
<h3 id="bad-breaks">Bad breaks</h3>
<p>Be sure you do not have bad page breaks or bad column breaks. One example of a bad column break is a “widow.”</p>
<p>A <strong>“widow”</strong> occurs when the last line of a paragraph 
that begins at the bottom of one column appears by itself at the top of 
the next column). If this happens, tighten the previous column to bring 
it back, or force an additional line of text over to the next column.</p>
<p>Also make sure that <strong><em>Section and Sub-section headings</em></strong> have at least two lines of body text below them when they appear at the end of a page or column.</p>
<h3 id="third-party-material">Third party material</h3>
<p>In the event any element used in your material contains the work of 
third-parties, it is the author/presenter’s responsibility to secure any
 necessary permissions and/or licenses, and the authors will provide the
 same permissions in writing to the ACM. If the copyright holder 
requires a citation to a copyrighted work, it is the authors’ 
responsibility to include the correct wording and citations to the 
copyrighted material in their submissions.</p>
<h3 id="images-and-figures">Images and figures</h3>
<p>Below are some recommendations to ensure good print reproduction of 
the images, figures, and illustrations utilized in your submission.</p>
<p>(a) <strong>Colors and Black &amp; White (Gray Scale) Print Testing</strong>.
 If you have any images in color, please print your paper out in black 
and white to ensure that the tones and screens used in your images or 
figures reproduce well in black and white, too. However, your images 
will appear in full color in any distributed electronic proceedings and 
in the ACM digital library.</p>
<p>(b) <strong>Resolution &amp; CMYK</strong>: Figures, charts, and 
diagrams should use a vector image format (e.g. PDF, SVG). Raster images
 (e.g. photographs) should be at least 300 or 600 dpi for quality 
reproduction and saved as .tif images (or other compatible formats that 
support print-quality resolution). When creating or revising your images
 for inclusion in the paper, we recommend choosing CMYK (and not RGB) as
 the color profile.</p>
<p>(c) <strong>TIFF/PNG versus JPG (JPEG) images</strong>: For raster 
images (e.g. photos), TIFFs are preferred for press applications where 
quality takes priority over file size. When TIFFs are compressed (using 
LZW compression option when saving from Adobe Photoshop, for example), 
no image data is lost, thus ensuring maximum quality. A JPEG is a 
compressed image format designed to keep the file size small, which 
makes it ideal for use in web graphics. However, to achieve this, the 
JPEG format actually removes precision from the image. This is referred 
to as a lossy compression system. On a printout, the removed data tends 
to show up as blocky areas of a solid color, or ghosting near 
high-contrast changes. At higher print resolutions (a minimum of 200 
dpi), there’s usually enough data in the JPEG file for the compression 
artefacts to be very noticeable.</p>
<p>(d) <strong>Rules/Lines</strong>: Rules used in your graphs, tables 
or charts must be at least 0.5 point in stroke and black for quality 
reproduction. Finer lines and points than this will not reproduce well, 
even if you can see them on your laser printed hardcopy when checked — 
your laser printers will usually have a far lower resolution than the 
imagesetters that will be used.</p>
<p>(e) <strong>Fonts</strong>: If your figure uses custom or any 
non-standard font, the characters may appear differently when printed in
 the proceedings. Remember to check your figure creation to ensure that 
all fonts are embedded or included in the figure correctly. <em>Be sure that your images do not contain any Type 3 fonts</em>.</p>
<p>(f) <strong>Transparency</strong>: If a figure or image is assembled 
from multiple images, the images must be embedded, and layers be 
flattened or grouped together properly in the file. Transparency <strong>must</strong> be flattened.</p>
<h3 id="page-numbering-headers-and-footers">Page numbering, headers, and footers</h3>
<p>Your final submission <strong>MUST NOT</strong> contain any footer or
 header string information at the top or bottom of each page, nor any 
page numbering. The submissions will be paginated in a determined order 
by the chairs and page numbers added to the PDF during the compiling, 
indexing, and pagination process.</p>
<h3 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h3>
<p>It is the contact or submitting author’s responsibility to be sure 
that any funding or special contribution acknowledgements are included 
in the final version submitted as required by any research, financial, 
or other grants received (by using the <strong>Acknowledgements</strong> section before the References section). <a href="https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/article-templates/sig-alternate-sample.pdf#page=4">See page 4 of the ACM sample PDF</a>.</p>
<h3 id="creating-an-acm-compliant-pdf-mandatory">Creating an ACM Compliant PDF (mandatory)</h3>
<p>Your PDF file must be ACM Compliant to be included in the Digital Library. Guidelines for producing <a href="http://www.sheridanprinting.com/typedept/ACM-DL-pdf-requirements.htm">ACM Compliant PDFs are provided by Sheridan Printing</a>.</p>
<p>(their URL incorrectly implies that the page is specific to Adobe Distiller).</p>
<p>That page provides instructions for exporting PDFs from Microsoft Word 2010, and an <a href="http://www.sheridanprinting.com/typedept/acm.joboptions">Adobe Distiller “joboptions” file</a>, for use with Distiller, or the full version of Adobe Acrobat.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="submitting-the-required-files">Submitting the Required Files</h2>
<p>When your final version is ready, you need to upload your PDF file on or before May 6 using EasyChair: <a class="uri" href="https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=debs2016">https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=debs2016</a>.<br>Please try to submit once, rather than submitting many drafts of your final version.</p>
<p>As an accepted author, you have access to the proceedings section of EasyChair.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-you-can-expect-will-happen-after-you-submit">What you can expect will happen after you submit</h2>
<h3 id="confirmation">Confirmation</h3>
<p>You will see a confirmation screen after a successful upload to 
EasyChair. As well, a confirmation email will be sent to the contact’s 
email address entered on the submission page.</p>
<h3 id="acm-copyright-form-to-be-completed">ACM Copyright Form to be completed</h3>
<p>The contact author of an accepted paper will receive an email with a 
link to the appropriate ACM electronic form to sign. The ACM eform 
usually only takes moments to complete. <em>Please give this matter your <strong>immediate attention</strong>, after you receive the link for the appropriate ACM copyrights and permissions form.</em></p>
<h3 id="if-changes-are-needed">If changes are needed…</h3>
<p>You will be contacted by one of the publication coordinators in case 
you need to fix something. If this is true, you will receive specific 
information about how to revise your submission to meet requirements, 
and a new deadline will be given to submit the corrected material. You 
are required by the chairs to adhere to this NEW deadline so publication
 is not delayed.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Usually, only one ACM copyright form is 
needed, and it can be signed by the lead or contact author. A second 
form may be requested from co-presenters depending on any US or foreign 
government affiliations. The ACM Copyrights-Permission office will 
notify you if a second form is needed.</p>
