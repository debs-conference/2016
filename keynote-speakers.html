	  <b>Abstract:</b>
	  <p>
 Distributed event-based systems are centred around the notion of
    event messages, which are generated by data producers, processed by
    intermediate entities, and received by data consumers. They exhibit
    a loosely-coupled architectural style, which results in scalable and
    robust system designs. This makes event-based systems extremely
    well-suited for the processing of event messages with low latency.

    In this talk, I will argue that event-based systems have been very
    influential within the distributed systems and databases communities
    over the past two decades. In particular, they have led to the
    design of modern low-latency data processing systems, both in
    industry and academia. Based on examples from my own research and
    from others, I will provide an overview of the evolution of
    event-based systems, starting from complex event processing (CEP)
    systems and distributed stream processing engines. More recently,
    these systems have given rise to distributed dataflow platforms such
    as Storm, Spark, Flink and SEEP, which can process large amounts of
    event data in near real-time by exploiting data parallelism. I will
    conclude the talk with open research challenges in event-based
    systems, which I believe will keep this community engaged for years
    to come.</p>

	  <b>Abstract:</b>
	  <p>Self-driving vehicles seem to have become quite the rage in popular culture over just the past few years, triggered in good part by the DARPA Grand Challenges. Self-driving vehicles indeed hold the potential to revolutionize modern transportation. This talk will provide some insights on many basic questions that, need to be addressed for the revolution to take place in practice. What are the technological barriers that currently prevent vehicles to be driverless? What can or cannot be sensed or recognized? Can vehicles recognize and comprehend as good as, if not better than, humans? Does connectivity play a role? Will the technology be affordable only for the few? How do issues like liability, insurance, regulations and societal acceptance impact adoption? The talk will be based on road experiences and will add some speculation.</p>

	  <b>Abstract:</b>
	  <p>With increasing availability of data in real-time, there has been a shift to proactive analytics rather than reactive, e.g., predictive maintenance of  equipment, demand prediction, fraud detection, dynamic pricing. Even for traditional applications of predictive analytics such as, but not limited to, churn management, cross-selling, propensity to purchase and customer lifetime prediction, there is a critical need to provide insights in real-time. In addition, several new applications involving IOT are driving the need to be in real-time. In light of the above, several real-time processing platforms – both open source as well as commercial – have been developed in recent years. In this talk, I will delve into what real time analytics means, why it is needed and how it is being deployed across organizations. Finally, I will give some ideas on where it is headed in the future.</p>

	  <b>Abstract:</b>
	  <p>With the increasing volumes of data being acquired, stored, and processed in the cloud, online and offline analytics to derive value from such data has become very important. At Microsoft Research, we have been exploring new system designs that cover a diverse range of analytics scenarios at high performance. In this talk, I will briefly describe Trill (stands for a trillion events per day), a streaming engine library used across Microsoft, that can execute relational, progressive, and real-time temporal queries at unprecedented levels of performance. I will then overview several new research directions in the Trill project, that expand the functionality of Trill for various application scenarios.</p>
          <p>Finally, I will introduce Quill (stands for a quadrillion tuples per day) - a distributed platform to scale relational and temporal analytics over large datasets in the cloud. Quill exposes an abstraction for parallel datasets and computation, called ShardedStreamable. This abstraction provides the ability to express efficient distributed physical query plans that are transferable, i.e., movable from offline to real-time and vice versa. Quill targets offline datasets, uses Trill as a library layer for query processing, and employs a master-less cloud design. Experiments on up to 40 high-end cloud machines, on benchmark and real datasets up to 1TB, find Quill to outperform SparkSQL by up to orders-of-magnitude for temporal and 6X for relational queries, while supporting a rich space of transferable, programmable, and expressive distributed physical query plans.</p>

	  <b>Abstract:</b>
	  <p>Streaming analytics is about identifying and responding to events happening in your business, in your service or application, and with your customers in near real-time. Sensors, mobile and IoT devices, social networks, and online transactions are all generating data that can be monitored constantly to enable a business to detect and then act on events and insights before they lose their value. The need for large scale, real-time stream processing of big data in motion is more evident than ever before but the potential remains largely untapped by most firms. It’s not the size but rather the speed at which this data must be processed that presents the greatest technical challenges. In this talk I will draw upon our experience with Amazon Kinesis data streaming services to highlight use cases, discuss technical challenges in scaling a data streaming service to massive scale, and look ahead to the future of stream data processing.</p>

	  <b>Abstract:</b>
	  <p>This paper presents theory and an implementation of a Distributed Event Based System (DEBS) platform. The theory is based on a simple model that, despite its simplicity, informs the implementation. Many software libraries operate on “data at rest’, i.e. fixed data structures such as arrays and graphs. By contrast, DEBS systems operate on “data in motion,” i.e., data structures that change, in increments, over time. Many software libraries are designed for sequential execution or synchronous parallel execution. By contrast, DEBS systems have multiple agents executing asyn- chronously. This paper presents theorems that show how programs that operate on data in motion can be constructed from programs that operate on data at rest. The paper presents sufficient conditions that enable programs operating on data at rest to be reconfigured as networks of asynchronous agents operating on data structures that change incrementally as time progresses.The paper provides a brief description of a DEBS platform, called StreamPy, implemented in Python. StreamPy is a partial reification of the theory presented here. StreamPy supports asynchronous computation and the use of libraries designed to operate on data at rest for data in motion. Plat- forms that support real time business intelligence have to be integrated with machine learning and AI tools; StreamPy supports integration of several software libraries for data analytics implemented in Python. </p>
